**The images annotator application**

# Goal of the ImagesAnnotator

The goal of the image annotator is to provide information about the provided images' located objects in order to supply annotated data to the learning networks with next load into libraries like [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv).

Current project also serves research purposes. So may look a bit over engineered.

Fast started with help of the C++ templated project located at [https://github.com/yuriysydor1991/cpp-app-template](https://github.com/yuriysydor1991/cpp-app-template)

# Usage

The main application window looks like next.

![ImagesAnnotator window view example](doc/images/ImagesAnnotator-0.11.0.png)

On the top located regular menu:

- `Images` to import images directories,
- `Annotations` to manage current project,
- `Help` for help options.

Next in line located buttons to open and append new image containing directory (duplicated functionality from `Images` menu), increase and decrease zoom on the current opened image, the next and previous image if any from the opened images in the queue (left list panel), and finally duplicated button to open already existing annotations DB (currently only internal JSON format is supported).

The images that are listed on the green background on the left panel indicating having at least one annotation.

On the right panel there are list all the annotations in the project list box and the currently opened image annotations only list box. The `Copy annotation name` button designed to copy text from a top list box selected annotation to the current image selected annotation. The `copy annotation` duplicates current selected image annotation. The delete button in the bottom of the current image annotations list designed to delete current image selected annotation respectively.

On the bottom of the window there is a status panel that currently indicates only opened JSON db file.

After annotating the images of interest, use the export submenu of the `Annotations` menu to export data to widely used annotation formats.

# Implementing custom exporters

Current ImagesAnnotator application stores the annotations database in the `JSON` file format. It makes it easy to implement a custom export script into required format to train neural network with the help of `Python` or `Bash`.

## Optional for the tests

If necessary to build and execute available tests install GTest or ensure available Internet access in order to project make it available by itself (GNU/Linux based):

```
sudo apt install -y googletest
```

Examine the [Project tests](#project-tests) for more info.

## Optional for the documentation

If necessary to generate the Doxygen documentation from the sources comments install doc generation system also (GNU/Linux based):

```
sudo apt install -y doxygen graphviz
```

Examine the [Documentation build](#documentation-build) section on how to enable documentation enable/build/install.

## Optional for the code formatting

To auto format code using available `clang-format` target the `clang-format` code formatter must be installed (GNU/Linux based):

```
sudo apt install -y clang-format
```

Examine configuring details in the [Enabling and performing code formatting target](#enabling-and-performing-code-formatting-target) subsection.

## Optional for the code analyzer (cppcheck)

In order to perform a static code analysis with the `cppcheck` command install it with next command (GNU/linux based):

```
sudo apt install -y cppcheck
```

## Optional for the code analyzer with clang-tidy

In order to perform a static code analysis with the `clang-tidy` command install it with next command (GNU/linux based):

```
sudo apt install -y clang-tidy
```

Examine the [Enabling the static code analyzer with clang-tidy](#enabling-the-static-code-analyzer-with-clang-tidy) section on how to enable the `cppcheck` target.

## Optional for the memory check with Valgrind

In order to enable the dynamic application check with the `valgrind` command install it with the command:

```
sudo apt install -y valgrind
```

For more details on how to enable and run the memory check target examine the [Enabling the dynamic memory check target with valgrind](#enabling-the-dynamic-memory-check-target-with-valgrind) section.

## Optional for the flatpak package

In order to generate the project flatpak package install the `flatpak-builder` command:

```
sudo apt install -y flatpak flatpak-builder
```

You'll also need the one of it's target SDK which may be installed by a command that may look like this:

```
flatpak install org.gnome.Platform/x86_64/48 org.gnome.Sdk/x86_64/48
```

Replace the `org.gnome.Platform/x86_64/48 org.gnome.Sdk/x86_64/48` with your preferred runtime and SDK. Consult the flatpak documentation on how to list all available options.

Look for the details at the [Enabling the flatpak package generation support](#enabling-the-flatpak-package-generation-support).

## Optional for the Docker container runs

In order to be able to start the Docker containers with the built application install it with the next command:

```
sudo apt install -y docker.io docker-buildx
```

Next, configure the docker service to start to listen the local machine loopback TCP interface with it's configuration file edit with command:

```
sudo systemctl edit docker
```

Insert the next lines into the end of the configure file for opened docker service:

```
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// -H tcp://127.0.0.1:2375
ExecReload=/bin/kill -s HUP $MAINPID
```

Save and close the configuration file. Now reload the systemctl and the Docker by itself:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker.service
```

To check if Docker works execute next command to run the simple `hello-world` container locally: 

```
DOCKER_HOST="tcp://127.0.0.1:2375" docker run hello-world
```

You may add the `export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://127.0.0.1:2375"` to your `.bashrc` file to avoid the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable inclusion into every docker command run by executing the command:

```
echo 'export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://127.0.0.1:2375"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Details at the section [Enabling the Docker container build and run](#enabling-the-docker-container-build-and-run)

# Project structure

## UI implementation

The project's `src/gtkmm3/ui/GtkmmWindow.ui` file contains the general application's UI default implementation. Open it with the [Glade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glade_Interface_Designer) application in order to edit project's UI implementation.

## Resource embedding

To avoid any install and run dependencies the `src/gtkmm3/ui/GtkmmWindow.ui` UI file and any other registered resource are embedding into the binary. Resource embedding is performed through the `src/gtkmm3/ui/template.gresource.xml` GResource file resources of which are compiled into the C-resource by a `glib-compile-resources` command. Register new resources in the `src/gtkmm3/ui/template.gresource.xml` file in order to make them available in the binary executable. The examples of the resource obtaining and usage in the C++ code side may be examined in the default implementation of the `gtkmm3` component.

## Introducing custom command line parameters

In order to introduce some additional command line parameters for the binary look for the `CommandLineParser` class implementation. It contains command line parsing routines that are passed by `ApplicationFactory` class after the `main` function was called.

Add some additional custom fields into the `ApplicationContext` class in order to pass some custom command line flags and/or data to the `IApplication` interface abstract class descendants that will be created by the `ApplicationFactory` during command line arguments parse.

The GTKmm library also supports some of the command line parameters which are passed to the GTKmm application by default.

## Version tracking and other project parameters

The project's `CMakeLists.txt` files are tracking of a current project git repository commit, project name, configure date and projects version that are forwarded into the projects's configure header file located at `src/app/project-global-decls.h.in`. The `project-global-decls.h.in` will be compiled into the build directory as `project-global-decls.h`. The `ApplicationVersionPrinter` class includes this project's configure file and uses the information provided to print appropriate version info. Usually, this code is executed by calling generated executable with a `-v` or `--version` command line flag. After the version is printed, the default implementation cause the application's `ApplicationVersionPrinter` instance to return zero value and cause the executable to stop it's execution.

## Project tests

Project already contains some simple test samples. Based on them you may implement full test of the introduced code. 

See the [Project build](#project-build) subsection to enable unit testing with CMake.

### Google Test

Currently tests are based on the GTest framework. GTest framework by itself becomes available by the `FetchContent_Declare`/`FetchContent_MakeAvailable` CMake-commands if no system GTest is available. 

Of course, the project's CMakeLists.txt files are probing the GTest only if tests are enabled by `ENABLE_UNIT_TESTS` CMake variable. System GTest probe may be turned OFF by setting appropriate value to the `GTEST_TRY_SYSTEM_PROBE` CMake variable.

Look for a `cmake/template-project-make-GTest-available.cmake` to see details or change GTest version etc.

# Project build

## IDE build

Of course if your IDE supports CMake build system integration you may just press the `Build` and/or `Run` button somewhere in the IDE window with opened project and it's done! No need to perform a search and execute commands.

## Command line build

The project uses the CMake build system so a build command should be familiar to the most of the C++ developers around the world!

Of course, project needs to be `git clone`-ed and it's root directory must be opened in the terminal or in your IDE first. After that you may execute next commands:

```
# from the project root

mkdir -vp build && cd build && cmake ../ && cmake --build . --target all
```

Which effectively will create a directory named `build` (it's already added to the `.gitignore` list), configure project using the CMake available in the system (see the [Requirements](#requirements) section of this `README.md` file) and finally builds all the targets available in the project.

## Enabling testing

### Enabling unit testing

To enable project unit test availability (for building and running) reconfigure it with enabled `ENABLE_UNIT_TESTS` variable as follows (GNU/Linux based):

```
# from the project root

mkdir -vp build && cd build && cmake ../ -DENABLE_UNIT_TESTS=ON && cmake --build . --target all
```

The `ctest` may be used afterwards.

### Enabling component testing

To enable project unit test availability (for building and running) reconfigure it with enabled `ENABLE_COMPONENT_TESTS` variable as follows (GNU/Linux based):

```
# from the project root

mkdir -vp build && cd build && cmake ../ -DENABLE_COMPONENT_TESTS=ON && cmake --build . --target all
```

The `ctest` may be used afterwards.

### Disabling system GTest probe 

To disable the system available GTest framework assets usage set appropriate value to the `GTEST_TRY_SYSTEM_PROBE` CMake variable by executing command like (GNU/Linux based):

```
mkdir -vp build && cd build && cmake ../ -DENABLE_UNIT_TESTS=ON -DGTEST_TRY_SYSTEM_PROBE=OFF && cmake --build . --target all
```

During command execution project build system will try to make GTest available through the Internet only for current project with specified version in the `cmake/template-project-make-GTest-available.cmake` file.

## Documentation build

Currently it's possible to auto-generate the project documentation by the Doxygen tool from the available sources comments.

To enable Doxygen documentation CMake-target during the project configure process call a command that sets the `ENABLE_DOC_DOXYGEN` CMake variable to the `ON` value (GNU/Linux based):

```
# inside the project root directory 

mkdir -vp build && cd build && cmake ../ -DENABLE_DOC_DOXYGEN=ON
```

Which effectively will create a directory named `build` inside the project root directory, enters it by a `cd` command and configures project to enable Doxygen documentation build.

Finally build the documentation by executing the command:

```
# inside the project build directory

cmake --build . --target Doxygen-doc
```

Which in turn will generate the `doc/ImagesAnnotator-html` directory (already added to the `.gitignore` file) which will contain the HTML-type documentation. In order to open and examine generated documentation open the `doc/ImagesAnnotator-html/index.html` file. The `ImagesAnnotator-html` directory name will change if changed default executable name for the project by setting a new value for the `PROJECT_BINARY_NAME` variable in the root `CMakeLists.txt` or the `DOXYGEN_OUT_HTML_NAME` which in turn set the whole name for the directory.

The `doc/Doxyfile.in` file contains all available Doxygen configuration parameters which may be changed in order to change the documentation output.

## Configuring the documentation install support

It's possible to enable support for the document installation by setting up the `ENABLE_DOC_DOXYGEN` and `DOXYGEN_DO_INSTALL` variables to `ON` value during the project configure stage.

```
# inside the project build directory

cmake ../ -DENABLE_DOC_DOXYGEN=ON -DDOXYGEN_DO_INSTALL=ON
```

The `DOXYGEN_OUT_HTML_NAME` CMake variable will configure the documentation html directory name (passed into the `Doxyfile`).

## Enabling and performing code formatting target

In order to make `clang-format` target available set the `ENABLE_CLANGFORMAT` variable value to `ON` during the project configuration stage (GNU/Linux based):

```
# inside the project root directory 

mkdir -vp build && cd build && cmake ../ -DENABLE_CLANGFORMAT=ON
```

To perform the whole project code format in accordance with available `misc/.clang-format` code formatter configuration execute next building command:

```
# inside the project build directory

cmake --build . --target clang-format
```

The `clang-format` target details may be examined and/or altered in the `cmake/template-project-clang-format-target.cmake` CMake submodule file.

## Enabling the static code analyzer target with cppcheck

In order to make the cppcheck target available for the execution, configure project with enabled `ENABLE_CPPCHECK` variable:

```
# inside the project root directory 

mkdir -vp build && cd build && cmake ../ -DENABLE_CPPCHECK=ON
```

And to perform the actual static code analysis by itself run the `cppcheck` target for the build:

```
# inside the project build directory

cmake --build . --target cppcheck
```

The `cppcheck` target details may be examined and/or altered in the `cmake/template-project-cppcheck-target.cmake` CMake submodule file.

## Enabling the static code analyzer with clang-tidy

In order to enable the static code check for the each translation unit or each `*.cpp` file in the project with a `clang-tidy` application enable it during the project configuration stage by setting the `ENABLE_CLANG_TIDY` variable value to `ON` in the configuration command:

```
# inside the project root directory

mkdir -vp build && cd build && cmake ../ -DENABLE_CLANG_TIDY=ON
```

And to perform the actual static code analysis by itself build any target of interest and the `clang-tidy` command will perform check on each of the compilation target:

```
# inside the project build directory

cmake --build . --target all
```

For more information about the `clang-tidy` examine the `cmake/template-project-clang-tidy-target.cmake`, `misc/.clang-tidy` files
and the `clang-tidy` application documentation of a used version.

**Warning!** The `clang-tidy` static code analysis may dramatically increase the code compilation time.

## Enabling the dynamic memory check target with valgrind

In order to make the `valgrind` target available for the execution, configure project with the enabled `ENABLE_VALGRIND` variable like:

```
# inside the project root directory 

mkdir -vp build && cd build && cmake ../ -DENABLE_VALGRIND=ON
```

To perform the dynamic memory check on the application build run next command:

```
# inside the project build directory

cmake --build . --target valgrind
```

The `valgrind` target details may be examined and/or altered in the `cmake/template-project-valgrind-target.cmake` CMake submodule file.

**Warning! It will start application.** The dynamic memory check requires application to be started and go through the full cycle. Ensure that application execution will have a finite time.

## Enabling DEB package generation with cpack

In order to be able to generate the `deb` package file configure project to support the `cpack` command feature with a `ENABLE_DEB` variable enabled:

```
# inside the project root directory 

mkdir -vp build && cd build && cmake ../ -DENABLE_DEB=ON
```

Next, build all available targets required for the `deb` package

```
# inside the project build directory

cmake --build . --target all
```

Finally, execute the `cpack` command inside the project build directory:

```
# inside the project build directory

cpack
```

The package file should be generated inside the project build root directory. For example, if project name was't change and it's version is 0.8.0 so the package name may look like `ImagesAnnotator-0.8.0-Linux.deb`.

In order to examine details of the `deb` package configuration visit the `cmake/template-project-deb-enabler.cmake` file.

## Enabling the flatpak package generation support

In order to enable the flatpak generation of the redistribution package on the project configure it with enabled option `ENABLE_FLATPAK` (GNU/Linux and alike):

```
# inside the project root directory 

mkdir -vp build && cd build && cmake ../ -DENABLE_FLATPAK=ON
```

Which in order will enable the `flatpak` target.

And finally to generate the flatpak package run the `flatpak` target for the build:

```
# inside the project build directory

cmake --build . --target flatpak
```

In case of the success target build, there will be created the flatpak file under the root build directory named, for example, the `ImagesAnnotator-0.9.0.flatpak`. In order to examine and/or change the flatpak generation target parameters visit the `cmake/template-project-flatpak-target.cmake` or `misc/flatpak.conf.json.in` files.

Refer to the flatpak documentation on how to install and run applications distributed from a flatpaks files. For the current project defaults the install and run command may look like this:

```
# to install (version may change)
# inside the project build directory
flatpak install --user ImagesAnnotator-0.9.0.flatpak

# to run the application
flatpak run ua.org.kytok.template.gtkmm3.0.ImagesAnnotator
```

## Enabling the Docker container build and run

To be able to build and run the Docker container with current project' target binary file enable it's CMake target with setting the `ENABLE_DOCKER` variable into value `ON` by using the next command:

```
# inside the project root directory

cmake -S . -B build -DENABLE_DOCKER=ON
```

After that there should be available the Docker build and run CMake target `docker-single-run` which may be triggered with the command:

```
# inside the project root directory

cmake --build build --target docker-single-run 
```

Examine the `cmake/dockerers/template-project-docker-single-runner-target.cmake` file for the `docker-single-run` target details.

## Enabling sanitizers

In order to enable the sanitizers to check application at the runtime, configure project with the command:

```
cmake -S . -B build -DENABLE_SANITIZERS=ON
```

For a general purpose sanitizers. See the `cmake/template-project-sanitizers.cmake` to examine available list of the sanitizers.

Alternatively, enable the threads sanitizers with the command:


```
cmake -S . -B build -DENABLE_SANITIZERS_THREADS=ON
```

to check the possible data rises of the newly introduced multithreaded application code.

Do not combine the `ENABLE_SANITIZERS` and `ENABLE_SANITIZERS_THREADS`.

Any findings will be printed into the application' stdout/stderr after the build and run.

## Enabling gprof profiler analisis

In order to perform the application profiler analysis with help of the `gprof` application enable it's support by setting the `ON` value for the `ENABLE_GPROF` CMake variable:

```
# Inside the source root directory

cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DENABLE_GPROF=ON
```

After configuring project with support for the `gprof` profiling facility build the `gprof-analyse` target:

```
# Inside the source root directory

cmake --build build --target gprof-analyze
```

Which will execute application and starts the `gprof` profiling analyze tool for `gmon.out` generated file under the project's build directory (for example `build/gmon.out`). The resulting analysis may be examined by `gprof-analyze.txt` under the project's build directory.

Profiling with the `gprof` may be enabled only with `Debug` build mode.

# Run the executable

## IDE run

Of course, if your IDE supports CMake build system integration you may just press the `Build` and/or `Run` button somewhere in the IDE window with opened project and it's done! No need to perform a search and execute commands.

## Command line run

### Searching for the generated executable

To find executable in the project build directory execute the `find` command:

```
find . -name 'ImagesAnnotator'
```

The `ImagesAnnotator` is a default executable name. Replace it with your custom one if you change the name of the project in the root `CMakeLists.txt` file (the `PROJECT_NAME` and/or `PROJECT_BINARY_NAME` variable).

### Starting the generated executable

If executable compiles and is present in the build directory start it in the terminal with path found from a previous subsection by a command:

```
# from the build dir
./src/ImagesAnnotator
```

Once again, the `ImagesAnnotator` is the **default** name of the project. Replace it with our own custom one if it was changed in the project's root `CMakeLists.txt` file (the `PROJECT_NAME` and/or `PROJECT_BINARY_NAME` variable).

## Tests run

### Run tests by the ctest

If enabled by the developer through the `ENABLE_UNIT_TESTS` variable and successfully build, the one may run all available test by the `ctest` command from a project build directory (GNU/Linux based):

```
# run from the project build directory

ctest
```

Alternatively, run the `ctest` command from any location by specifying the test dir (GNU/Linux based):

```
ctest --tests-dir /path/to/the/project/build/directory
```

In order to run particular test execute the `ctest` command with test's name after the `-R` command line flag. For example, for the `UTEST_ApplicationFactory` test it'll look something like this:

```
# from the project build directory 

ctest -R UTEST_ApplicationFactory
```

### Manual tests run

Currently tests are separated in different files named with `UTEST_*` pattern for the unit tests.

You may search for all compiled available tests by a next command:

```
# from the project root or a build directory

find -type f -executable -name 'UTEST_*'
```

After that, choose particular test of interest and execute it manually if needed. For example, for the `ApplicationFactory` class pass it's UT relative file system path from a project's root directory into the command line and hit enter (GNU/Linux based):

```
# from the project root

./build/src/app/tests/unit/ApplicationFactory/UTEST_ApplicationFactory
```

# Installing

Execute available install commands from the project's build directory.

## Default installation

In order to install generated executable (as shown previous) file into your's system binary default folder execute next command in the command line (GNU/Linux based):

```
# installs generated binary under the /usr/local/bin/ for example
# run from the project's build directory

sudo cmake --install .
```

Usually it's the `/usr/local/bin/` directory (on the Unix-like OS) which may be inaccessible from the `PATH` environment variable (e.g. can not be started as a regular command).

## Custom installation path

To install binary into the system globally available directory add the `--prefix` parameter to the command above as next:

```
# replace the /usr path with our own if needed
# run from the project's build directory

sudo cmake --install . --prefix "/usr"
```

Examine the `PATH` environment variable to chose directory best suited for your current OS (execute `echo $PATH` in the terminal). Alternatively, any path may be specified.

## Documentation install

If project was configured to support the documentation install by the command which looks like next:

```
# inside the project build directory

cmake ../ -DENABLE_DOC_DOXYGEN=ON -DDOXYGEN_DO_INSTALL=ON
```

The installation command (for example, described in the [Default installation](#default-installation) section) will install the generated HTML documentation files into appropriate directories.
